## Goal
To provide live information of cinematic industry from [*TMDB api*](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3).

## About project
This project is my latest React practical project from scratch to get in touch more with [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) and [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). As a react development project, I had to work with many components and data flows. I learned fundamental concepts of [**IMDB**](https://www.imdb.com/) and [**TMDB**](https://www.themoviedb.org/) websites to develop a more reliable website to deliver information to users. I used [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/) to test out UI designs and themes along with the coding.
